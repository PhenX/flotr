================
Flotr is a javascript plotting library based on the Prototype Javascript Framework 
(version 1.6.0.2 at the moment) and inspired by Flot (written by Ole Laursen). 
Flotr enables you to draw appealing graphs in most modern browsers with an
easy to learn syntax. It comes with great features like legend support, negative
value support, mouse tracking, selection support, zoom support, event hooks, CSS
styling support and much more.
