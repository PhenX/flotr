#summary Flotr Frequently Asked Questions

*When I draw a graph with a point series, the points have no border when viewing with IE.*
 Make sure you include the Excanvas javascript file that comes with Flotr. This file includes a fix.

*Does Flotr support negative values?*
 Yes, it does. There’s an example of a graph with negative values.

*My graphs with filled lines and bars look distorted in Opera 9.5-, why?*
 I’m not sure why, but it doesn’t occur in Opera 9.50 beta1, so just be patient and wait for Opera 9.5+.

*Which browsers are supported?*
 Firefox 2+, Safari 3+, Opera 9+ and IE6+.

*I found a bug, what can I do?*
 Don’t panic. First thing you do is try to fix it. Then, go to the Flotr Google Project page, and file a bug in the issue tracker.

*Do you give support for Flotr?*
 I distribute Flotr ‘as is’, I don not get paid for it and therefore I have no time to do support for it and I won’t answer trivial questions.

*My question’s still not answered, how do I contact you?*
 I do not guarantee any support. But you could try to contact me by either using the contact form on my contact page, or leave a comment on this page.
